#### Challenges Faced

**1. SCSS Import Path Issues**
- `Problem:` Nebular Eva Icons CSS not properly loaded
- `Error:` Build succeeded but styles missing at runtime
- `Root Cause:` External library CSS not properly referenced in build config
- `Solution:` Added external styles path to `angular.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "styles": [
      "src/styles.scss",
      "node_modules/@nebular/eva-icons/eva-icons.css"
    ]
  }
  ```
- `Time to Fix:` 30 minutes
- `Lesson Learned:` Understand Angular build system configuration, don't assume library setup works automatically

**2. Responsive Design Complexity**

- `Solution:` Implemented mobile-first approach:
  ```scss
  // Mobile first
  $tablet: 768px;
  $desktop: 1024px;
  
  @media (min-width: $tablet) {
    // Tablet changes
  }
  ```
- `Time to Fix:` 1 day (2-3 iterations on different devices)
- `Lesson Learned:` Test on real devices, not just browser dev tools; consider touch targets on mobile

---

### Phase 3: Complex Systems (Week 5-6)

#### What I Did
- Created **Task Manager Application** (*Personal Project for Practice & Mastery*) - Full-featured dashboard:
  - **Input Section** - Add new tasks with description and category
  - **Progress Bar** - Visual representation of completion percentage
  - **Filter System** - Filter tasks by category (Work, Personal, Learning)
  - **Task List** - Display all tasks with checkboxes, delete buttons
  - **Dashboard Summary** - Show total, completed, pending task counts
  - *Purpose:* Intensive practice in state management, reactive programming, and UX design
  
- Implemented **State Management** using RxJS:
  - Created `TaskService` with `BehaviorSubject` for state
  - Implemented task CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Used observables for reactive updates
  - Handled subscription cleanup to prevent memory leaks

- Built **Form Validation**:
  - Required field validation
  - Min/max length validation
  - Custom validators
  - Real-time form feedback

- Optimized for **Mobile Responsiveness**:
  - Touch-friendly button sizes (44px minimum)
  - Stack layout on mobile, grid on desktop
  - Simplified navigation for small screens

#### Architecture Implemented
```
TaskManagerComponent (Container)
├── TaskInputComponent
├── ProgressComponent
├── FilterComponent
└── TaskListComponent
    └── TaskItemComponent

TaskService (RxJS BehaviorSubject)
├── tasks$ (Observable<Task[]>)
├── addTask()
├── deleteTask()
├── completeTask()
└── getTasksByCategory()
```

#### Commits in This Phase
- 8+ commits covering components, services, and styling

#### Technologies Mastered
✅ RxJS Observables and Subjects  
✅ BehaviorSubject state management  
✅ Reactive Forms (FormBuilder, FormControl)  
✅ Event handling and data binding  
✅ Service-based architecture  
✅ Component composition patterns  

#### Challenges Faced

**3. RxJS State Management Race Conditions**
- `Problem:` Loading multiple tasks simultaneously caused data inconsistency
- `Symptoms:` 
  - Tasks appeared, then disappeared
  - Completion status flickered
  - Delete operation sometimes failed silently
- `Root Cause:` Multiple simultaneous subscriptions not properly synchronized
- `Solution:` Implemented centralized BehaviorSubject store:
  ```typescript
  private tasksSubject = new BehaviorSubject<Task[]>([]);
  tasks$ = this.tasksSubject.asObservable();
  
  addTask(task: Task) {
    const current = this.tasksSubject.value;
    this.tasksSubject.next([...current, task]);
  }
  ```
- `Additional:` Used async pipe in template to auto-unsubscribe
  ```html
  <app-task-item *ngFor="let task of tasks$ | async"></app-task-item>
  ```
- `Time to Fix:` 1 day (research + implementation + testing)
- `Lesson Learned:` Apply async pipe for auto-subscription cleanup; understand Observable behavior; test asynchronous code thoroughly

**4. Form Validation Edge Cases**
- `Problem:` User could submit empty tasks, blank strings, very long inputs
- `Solution:` Implemented validation:
  ```typescript
  validators: [
    Validators.required,
    Validators.minLength(3),
    Validators.maxLength(100)
  ]
  ```
- `Time to Fix:` 2 hours (design + implementation)

## 🔴 Challenges & Resolutions

### Challenge 1: Git History Divergence

**When:** March 18, 2026  
**Severity:** High (blocked deployment)

**The Problem:**
```
$ git push origin main
 ! [rejected] main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/...'
```
Local commits were not part of the remote history. This happened after a force push by someone else on the team.

**Why It Happened:**
- Remote had different commit history than local
- Forced push (`git push --force`) was used elsewhere
- Local branch fell behind the new remote state

**Solution Applied:**
```bash
# 1. Fetch latest remote state
git fetch origin

# 2. Rebase local commits on top of new remote history
git rebase origin/main

# 3. Force push (if safe, with team communication)
git push origin main
```

**Key Learning:**
- Understand Git DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
- Fast-forward merges vs. three-way merges
- Dangers of force push in team environment
- How to recover from divergent histories

**Prevention for Future:**
- Keep local branch synchronized with remote
- Coordinate force pushes with team
- Use rebase instead of merge for clean history

### Challenge 2: SCSS Library Import Failure

**When:** March 6, 2026  
**Severity:** High (styling completely broken)

**The Problem:**
Icons were not displaying; Nebular Eva Icons CSS not loading in production build.

**Investigation:**
```
✅ dev-server: Icons display fine (!!)
❌ production build: Icons missing & styling broken
```

**Root Cause:**
External CSS file from `node_modules/@nebular/eva-icons/eva-icons.css` wasn't included in the build process by default.

**Solution Applied:**
Modified `angular.json`:
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "app": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "options": {
            "styles": [
              "src/styles.scss",
              "node_modules/@nebular/eva-icons/eva-icons.css"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes

**Key Learnings:**
- Angular CLI build configuration specifics
- How external styles must be referenced
- Difference between dev-server and production build
- Library documentation importance
- Testing in production builds, not just dev

---

### Challenge 3: Mobile Responsive Design Breakage

**When:** March 17-19, 2026  
**Severity:** Critical (app unusable on mobile)

**The Problem:**
Tabs and pagination components completely broken on mobile devices:
- Text overflow beyond screen
- Buttons not properly spaced
- Touch targets too small
- Layout collapsed in unexpected ways

**Investigation Process:**
1. Tested on browser dev tools mobile emulator ✅
2. Tested on actual iPhone (via remote testing) ❌
3. Tested on Android device ❌
4. Found 3 different issues on 3 different devices

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Viewport not optimized**
   ```html
   <!-- Missing or incorrect -->
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
   ```

2. **Hard-coded pixel widths**
   ```scss
   // Bad - doesn't scale
   width: 1200px;
   padding: 20px;
   
   // Good - responsive
   width: 100%;
   max-width: 1200px;
   padding: clamp(1rem, 2vw, 2rem);
   ```

3. **No mobile-first media queries**
   ```scss
   // Bad - desktop-first (mobile-last)
   @media (max-width: 768px) { }
   
   // Good - mobile-first
   @media (min-width: 768px) { }
   ```

**Solution Applied:**
Implemented mobile-first responsive design:

```scss
// Mobile styles by default
.tab-button {
  padding: 12px;
  font-size: 16px;
  width: 100%;
}

// Tablet and up
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .tab-button {
    padding: 16px 24px;
    width: auto;
  }
}

// Desktop and up
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .tab-button {
    padding: 20px 32px;
  }
}
```

**Testing Strategy:**
- Tested on 5+ actual devices (phone, tablet, laptop)
- Used Chrome DevTools device emulation
- Tested in both portrait and landscape
- Verified touch interaction (not just mouse hover)

**Time to Fix:** 2-3 days (including testing on multiple devices)

**Key Learnings:**
- Always test on real devices, not just emulators
- Mobile-first approach is superior
- Use modern CSS features (clamp, max-width)
- Touch targets need 44px minimum
- Test landscape and portrait orientations
- Avoid hard-coded pixel values

---

### Challenge 4: RxJS Observable Race Conditions

**When:** March 24-25, 2026  
**Severity:** High (data inconsistency)

**The Problem:**
Task Manager app showed flickering behavior:
- New tasks appeared then disappeared
- Completion status reversed unexpectedly
- Delete operations failed silently sometimes

**Symptoms:**
```
Expected Flow:
1. User clicks "Add Task"
2. Task appears in list
3. Task persists ✅

Actual Flow:
1. User clicks "Add Task"
2. Task appears briefly
3. Task disappears ❌
4. No error message ⚠️
```

**Root Cause:**
Multiple simultaneous subscriptions without proper synchronization:

```typescript
// Problematic code
tasks$: Observable;
constructor(private service: TaskService) {
  this.tasks$ = this.service.getTasks();
}

// In template: Multiple subscriptions
{{ (tasks$ | async)?.length }}
<div *ngIf="(tasks$ | async) as tasks">
  <task-item *ngFor="let task of tasks"></task-item>
</div>
```
Each `async` pipe created a new subscription, leading to race conditions.

**Solution Implemented:**

```typescript
// Use BehaviorSubject for single source of truth
private taskSubject = new BehaviorSubject<Task[]>([]);
tasks$ = this.taskSubject.asObservable();

addTask(task: Task) {
  // Get current value, add new task, emit updated array
  const current = this.taskSubject.value;
  this.taskSubject.next([...current, task]);
}

deleteTask(id: string) {
  const current = this.taskSubject.value;
  const filtered = current.filter(t => t.id !== id);
  this.taskSubject.next(filtered);
}
```

**In Template:**
```html
<!-- Single async pipe -->
<ng-container *ngIf="tasks$ | async as tasks">
  {{ tasks.length }}
  <task-item *ngFor="let task of tasks"></task-item>
</ng-container>
```

**Time to Fix:** 1 day (debugging + research + testing)

**Key Learnings:**
- BehaviorSubject provides synchronous current value access
- Always use async pipe (auto-subscription cleanup)
- Understand cold vs. hot observables
- Test asynchronous behavior thoroughly
- Avoid multiple subscriptions to same observable
